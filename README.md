# Deep Learning Batch Selection Algorithm
The goal of our project is to create a batch selection algorithm that is able to make the learning process faster by carefully selecting corresponding instances in every batch. Our hope is to outperform random shuffling that is commonly used in deep learning problems.  

## Datasets
To measure the success of our ideas weâ€™re going to use a variety of datasets and neural network architectures in order to get relevant benchmarks. Some of these are well-known preprocessed datasets while we also create some of our own data.
These are the following:
Dataset       | Architecture  | Source
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Fahsion MNIST  | CNN |
MNIST  | CNN |

## Metrics
We measure the success rate of our custom algorithm based on how much **time** is needed for the neural network to achieve a given accuracy. When working on different computers we also check the number of **epochs** needed for a given loss.
